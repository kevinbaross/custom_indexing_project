# Custom Indexing Project

####  This project intends to build a custom indexing engine that would allow an average investor to build their own index fund based on their values and also compare performance of the custom index to original benchmark index using Monte Carlo simulation.  It provides investors the ability to customize their funds based on their budget and thematic preferences.  New Index constituents are calculated by weights and fractional share allocation.

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [python] (https://wiki.python.org/moin/FrontPage) - is an object-oriented, interpreted, and interactive programming language.

* [pathlib] (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) - This module offers classes representing filesystem paths with semantics appropriate for different operating systems.

* [matplotlib] (https://matplotlib.org) - Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

* [numpy] (https://numpy.org) - NumPy brings the computational power of languages like C and Fortran to Python, a language much easier to learn and use. 

* [SQLAlchemy] (https://www.sqlalchemy.org) - SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.

* [hvPlot] (https://hvplot.holoviz.org/) - hvPlot provides an alternative for the static plotting API provided by Pandas and other libraries, with an interactive Bokeh-based plotting API that supports panning, zooming, hovering, and clickable/selectable legends.

* [streamlit] (https://streamlit.io/) - Streamlit is an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science teams.

* [questionary] (https://questionary.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)- Questionary is a Python library for effortlessly building pretty command line interfaces.

* [pyviz] (https://pyviz.org/)- The PyViz.org website is an open platform for helping users decide on the best open-source (OSS) Python data visualization tools for their purposes, with links, overviews, comparisons, and examples.
